ChatCalculator is a minecraft mod that enables you to enter a mathematical formula into the chat and get it calculated ingame - without the need to leave the game!

### Usage

Simply type in your term, prefixed by an equals sign and press enter. The result will be sent to your chat only, your formula will not be broadcasted server wide, if in a multiplayer session.

    =(5+3)*7
    
This will produce the following output:

![Result of entering =(5+3)*7 into the chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RicoBrase/ChatCalculator/ebab90fa8135eb74357a667dac6f055b330088af/src/main/resources/assets/chatcalc/screenshot_1.png)

Want to share a calculation with your friends on the server? Prefix your formula with @= and the result will be send to every player on the server!

    @=(3^4)+9
    
This will produce the following output:  
   
![Result of entering =(3^4)+9 into the chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RicoBrase/ChatCalculator/ebab90fa8135eb74357a667dac6f055b330088af/src/main/resources/assets/chatcalc/screenshot_2.png)

Prefixing your chat message with double-equals (`==`) will allow you to send chat messages that start with a single equals sign.

**Please note** - your regular chat messages can't start with `==` (and `@=` in multiplayer) if you install this mod.
